# FIFO-CogVideoX
FIFO applied to CogVideoX models

FIFO: https://jjihwan.github.io/

Current Status: Issue with generating the latents and frames. Current output is just noisy frames. Need to check whats wrong.

`sample_fifo` -> reference file from the original FIFO implementation.

`cogvideo` -> my code for testing fifo cogvideo. Run it as `python ./cogvideo.py`

`cogvideo` -> my code for testing fifo cogvideo but based on the original latent creation & not from `sample_fifo.py`. Run it as `python ./cogvideo_base.py`
